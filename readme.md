# Budget Application

This is a project from "The complete JS course" by Jonas Schmedtmann from Udemy. This is not a copy. I was trying to do things along with the author but my own way.

## Approaches and technologies that have been used:

- Module pattern
- Closures
- Function constructors
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
